## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.  This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment option to its clients.

The following methods are used for thisanalysis:

~Preprocessing the database,
~Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
~Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
~Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
